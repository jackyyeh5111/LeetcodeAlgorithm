# [9] Palindrome Number

## 1. Problem:
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: True
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

*Follow up:*
Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
## 2. Note:
First reverse integer through the solution of problem 7. Chech that the sum of the reversed integer and the original integer equals to twice times of original image. True if equal, and vice versa.
